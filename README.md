* Assignment #3: Grammar Parsing

## Files Used
* Main Program: exp.cpp (no header file used)
* Primary File Processing: Validate.cpp, Validate.h
* Assistant Files: Parser.cpp, Parser.h (breaks up tokens to validate individually)
* Compiler: makefile

## Compiler + Runtime Instructions
* First, enter "make" (I used Putty to test on edoras, where the "%" character does not need to show before each command. If this is the case on the grader's end, accomodate for this accordingly for each step ) to compile all files given.
* Second, enter "exp". The program will automatically look for a file named "ex.txt" in the same folder (the test files must be named "ex.txt" or this program will not be able to find the files, this was the way the test files were supposed to be named). The output will be printed to the console, and no alternate file outputs are used.
